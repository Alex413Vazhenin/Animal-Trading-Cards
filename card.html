			<p class="lion-info">Lions are very social cats and live in groups called prides. Lions also go toe-to-toe with animals much larger than themselves. Lions can kill animals that weigh up to 1,000 lbs., according to the Smithsonian National Zoo. To kill their prey, lions use their powerful jaws to snap the prey's neck or to strangle it to death.</p>
